Moreover, international students are given a visa\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor an extended period of one year beyond the duration of their studies\n\t\t\t\t\t\t(STEM students get an extension of two years).

The class size is relatively\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsmall, which allows the professors to nurture a dedicated academic\n\t\t\t\t\t\trelationship with their students.

To make the\n\t\t\t\t\t\ttransition to US campus life smoother for undergraduate students,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tuniversities conduct orientation for them upon arrival.

Despite Cricket being a religion in India and Indians being\n\t\t\t\t\t\tobsessed with the Bollywood film industry, sports and co-curricular\n\t\t\t\t\t\tactivities such as performing arts have not been given the kind of\n\t\t\t\t\t\timportance that they deserve at school or college-level. Fortunately, there\n\t\t\t\t\t\tis light at the end of the tunnel! The New Education Policy (NEP) 2020 is\n\t\t\t\t\t\tbeing heralded as a long overdue overhaul that the Indian Education system\n\t\t\t\t\t\tneeds.
