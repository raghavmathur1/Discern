						Europe and Central Asia or the ECA region forms a fascinating potpourri of
						cultures, ethnicities and languages that constitute a rich learning
						environment for language, social, historical, political or economic studies.
						<br />
						<br />
						A few countries in the ECA region such as Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic
						and Kyrgyzstan are very popular among international students as attractive
						education destinations. Several universities in these countries are approved
						by the Medical Council of India (MCI) and hence, Indian students seeking to
						pursue Medicine often choose to study here as the admission requirements are
						few and quite simple.

						Many top universities in countries like Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic,
						Hungary, Lithuania and Romania offer courses taught in the English language.
						This draws international students to pursue studies in the ECA region.

						that!
